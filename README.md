## The Story Behind ZaraHarvest

### A Season in Kwame's Words

Kwame Asante has farmed two acres of maize outside Kumasi, Ghana for 15 years. He rises at 4 AM, watching the horizon to guess when the rains will arrive and trusting middlemen to set fair prices. Last season, sudden storms ruined half his crop. The buyer insisted the surviving maize was "low quality" and paid him 30% below market value. When Kwame asked for a small loan to buy improved seed, the bank turned him away - no collateral, no credit.

Kwame's story is shared by millions of African smallholder farmers who shoulder climate uncertainty, information gaps, and predatory market dynamics while feeding the continent.

### What Changed With ZaraHarvest

Today, Kwame opens the ZaraHarvest mobile dashboard before stepping into the field. Hyperlocal weather alerts tell him when to plant, AI yield forecasts show what he can harvest, and blockchain-backed contracts guarantee a fair price before he sells. His harvest is digitized as a tokenized asset, giving lenders the confidence to finance quality inputs. Kwame finished the last season with a 20% yield increase and plans to expand into legumes next year.
